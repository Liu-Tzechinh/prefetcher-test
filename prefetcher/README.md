Repository contains the source code for the IPCP prefetching framework.
The following prefetching source code can be used with the ChampSim microarchitectural simulator: https://github.com/ChampSim/ChampSim 
(1) ipcp_isca2020.l1d_pref (for L1-D prefetching) 
(2) ipcp_isca2020.l2c_pref (for L2 prefetching) 

Please refer the IPCP paper (https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/biswap/IPCP_ISCA20.pdf) for the implementation details.
